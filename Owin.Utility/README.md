# AWhewell.Owin.Utility

Utility classes that handle some of the repetitive jobs when dealing with
OWIN implementations.

The classes do not assume that the AWhewell.Owin library is being used. They
should be usable with any OWIN implementation.

All other AWhewell.Owin libraries are allowed to refer to this library but
this library is not allowed to refer to anything else.
